# hidden structure autoencoder
### Isomorph Autoencoder. 

The idea here is to figure out how I built an autoencoder for understanding latent variables where the measured things are binary, but the actual mechanism the measurements are not binary.

Like, imagine data on green and red lights in a large city signalling trafic flow. If such data is poor, how can I reconstruct it without messing with the integrity of the underlying item of interest, as in the flow of trafic.
